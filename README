This is a synthesizer implementation in C++.

The input is read from /dev/snd/midiC*D* directly, where my KORG nanoKEY is connected to. (rawinput at its lowest level).
The output is handled through alsa library.
The soundwaves are generated by the software. It has 2 oscillator channels (square, pulse, triangle, sawtooth, sine), an LFO for pitch-volume, and envelope.

In order to use it, compile the source with -lpthread -lasound (or just use ./make), and don't forget to replace /dev/snd/midiC*D* (in the source code) with your MIDI device input.
